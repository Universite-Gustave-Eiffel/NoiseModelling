# Contributing to NoiseModelling

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to NoiseModelling. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [NoiseModelling Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for NoiseModelling. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

*   **Check the [issues](https://github.com/Universite-Gustave-Eiffel/NoiseModelling/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported.
*   **Open a new issue**. Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:
    *   Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
    *   Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
    *   Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
    *   Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
    *   Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the reproduction steps.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for NoiseModelling, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

*   **Check the [issues](https://github.com/Universite-Gustave-Eiffel/NoiseModelling/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/Universite-Gustave-Eiffel/NoiseModelling/discussions)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested.
*   **Open a new issue** or start a **new discussion**. Describe the enhancement and provide as much detail as possible.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to NoiseModelling? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

*   [Good first issues](https://github.com/Universite-Gustave-Eiffel/NoiseModelling/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
*   [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/Universite-Gustave-Eiffel/NoiseModelling/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue`.

### Pull Requests

*   **Fork the repository** and clone it locally.
*   Create a branch for your edits.
*   Make sure your code lints and tests pass.
*   **Submit a pull request** to the `main` branch.
*   If you're adding a new feature, add tests for it.

## Styleguides
