	abstract = {State-of-the-art urban road traffic noise propagation simulation methods such as the CNOSSOS-EU framework rely on ray tracing to estimate noise levels at specific locations on façades, so-called receiver points; this method is computationally expensive and its cost increases with the number of receiver points, which limits the spatial accuracy of such simulations in the context of real-time or near-real-time urban noise simulation applications. This contribution aims to investigate the applicability of multiple data-driven methods to the surrogate modelling of traffic noise propagation for fast façade noise calculation as an alternative to these traditional, ray-tracing-based methods. The proposed approach uses compressed sensing to select a small subset of receiver points from which the data set of the entire façade may be reconstructed, associated with a Kriging model and neural networks, used to predict noise levels for these sensors. The prediction performance of each of these steps is evaluated on an academic test case, with two levels of complexity based on the dimensionality of the problem.},

Each hour, a noise map is generated by the meta-model with the measured traffic and weather data. This map is algorithmically merged with the measured readings to form a new composite map. The resulting analyzed map is the best linear unbiased estimator under certain assumptions. The performance is evaluated with leave-one-out cross-validation. The performance of the method depends on the accuracy of the meta-model, the input parameters of the meta-model and the structure of the error covariances between the simulated noise level errors. With 16 microphones over an area of 3 km2, this new method achieves a reduction of 30\% of the root-mean-square error when compared to a meta-model only.},

The simulation, which reproduces 3 hours of a morning rush hour scenario, highlights the increase in noise levels associated with the increase in travel demands. It also highlights that the increase in noise levels is not uniformly distributed over the network and has a greater impact on the streets where traffic is reported. In addition, noise dynamics are modified: background noise is particularly sensitive to the increase in vehicle density on the network, so periods of calm on the network are rare. A more detailed analysis of this dynamic is possible locally through the analysis of the evolution of the LAeq,1s and the study of specific acoustic indicators. Desirable improvements to the model are discussed, with a view to assessing the currently unknown acoustic impact of road traffic management strategies at the scale of an urban network.},

	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4612924},
	abstract = {Noise mapping is widely utilized to assess noise exposure and formulate noise mitigation policies.  However, in practice, noise mapping faces several challenges: (1) it may oversimplify the actual settings and use inaccurate geospatial data and/or inappropriate parameters, (2) noise mapping requires expert knowledge and complex computations,  and (3) it is time-consuming.  To address these issues, the author propose an approach for dynamically generating small noise maps with a system designed to predict sound levels.  Instead of presenting static noise maps with fixed geometries and calculation parameters, this approach offers a dynamic noise mapping system.  The author implemented this noise mapping system as a plugin for the "QGIS" software, seamlessly integrating geospatial databases provided by the government and public agencies, along with a sound-level calculation module named "NoiseModelling".   The performance and validity of the system were evaluated by applying it to real cases in Japan.  Noise maps were generated efficiently, and the predicted results closely matched measured data although adjustments to the geospatial inputs were necessary to reflect the actual conditions in some instances.  The system leverages a geospatical database for trunk roads in Japan, providing essential data for predicting sound levels; therefore, its development demonstrates the feasibility of assessing road traffic noise in the vicinity of nearly all trunk roads in Japan.  The dynamic generation of noise maps facilitates the refinement of input data and parameters, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy and enabling noise mapping in diverse scenarios.  The proposed approach holds promise for practical noise map applications, fostering collaboration between experts and non-specialits through the creation of noise maps.},

CNOSSOS-EU, widely adopted as the reference for strategic noise mapping across Europe and beyond, provides an semi-empirical model for noise propagation based on experimental algorithms and simplifications. While robust, CNOSSOS-EU’s approach can overlook the complex physical and geometric characteristics of certain environments, particularly in detailed or high-stakes noise assessments. To address these limitations, this work demonstrates how FEM—rooted in fundamental physical principles—can serve as a powerful adjunct to CNOSSOS-EU, offering finer detail in modeling noise propagation in complex environments. By comparing and validating FEM-derived results against those of CNOSSOS-EU, this study identifies key discrepancies and analyzes their implications for noise management strategies. The findings underscore the added value of integrating FEM, ultimately supporting more informed decision-making and the development of effective noise control measures.},

	abstract = {This research presents a modeling framework that allows checking the statistical requirements for producing noise maps based on mobile measurements. First, a sound field of reference is created based on a micro-simulation traffic modeling coupled with acoustic modeling, which outputs sound levels each second on a grid of receivers. The aggregated indicators (LAeq) calculated from this sound field serve then as reference. Mobile targets performing measurements evolve within the simulation, aiming to estimate these indicators. The difference between the reference noise map and the one generated by the moving receivers, characterized by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), is computed for different aggregation radius of mobile receivers, and as a function of the number of passes-by and to the distance to its nearest cross street. It is observed that the mobile sampling is actually possible and the RMSE can be reduced by setting an optimal aggregation radius and a minimum number of passes-by. With the optimal parameters, 95\% of the mobile samples fall within an estimation error interval of [−3.0, 2.2] dBA from the reference. It is also shown that the distance to the nearest cross street affects the estimation error depending on the traffic flow, producing a RMSE greater than 2 dB for distances lower than 30 m.},

framework tailored to calculate sound levels in specific environments within small, arbitrary regions. Using the open-source noise prediction tool NoiseModelling and global databases of road networks, buildings, terrain, and population distribution on QGIS, this framework seamlessly integrates
noise mapping procedures, including comprehensive data collection, receiver placement, sound level calculation, and visualization. The user-friendly graphical interfaces enable quick and easy generation of noise maps. The approach offers flexibility through customizable geometry and parameter
settings to account for variations in noise sources and propagation characteristics, thereby providing stakeholders with valuable insights for policy formulation, environmental impact assessment, and community engagement. This methodology not only improves the accessibility and relevance of
noise mapping but also empowers decision makers to implement tailored noise mitigation strategies that promote healthier and more livable environments.},

this work combines brightness and noise maps to establish the contours of a reserve of darkness and silence in Sherbrooke's Mont-Bellevue Park (Québec, Canada). The light and sound environments of the city are mapped by the research team using two devices mounted on vehicles or bicycles:
a multispectral and multidirectional brightness sensor and a sound level meter. Long-term and fixed-point light and noise measurements were also conducted to develop the mobile measurement protocol. Wind tunnel measurements in an anechoic chamber were finally used to determine the effect of
travel speed on measured noise levels, showing that speeds of less than 15 km/h ensure unbiased acoustic measurements using a windscreen. Perspectives include using the Noise Capture application to provide crowdsourced and additional noise levels at fixed measurement points. The open-source
Noise Modelling tool will provide us with calculated environmental noise maps to be compared with measured data.},

For some groups of citizens, such as school children, patients, and elders, there is a need to support them in finding pedestrian routes in noise polluted areas of cities. In this paper, we focus on the estimation of traffic noise, and present an approach to provide quiet routing services, taking into account the estimated noise levels of roads. By combining Volunteered Geographic Information, official socio-economic data, and open-access GPS trajectory data, we develop a set of traffic related variables, and apply machine learning methods to perform traffic volume estimations. Given the estimated traffic information, an existing traffic noise model is then employed to derive the noise polluted areas. For generation of quiet routes, a new routing algorithm is proposed based on the Dijkstra algorithm. It minimizes the exposure of pedestrians to traffic noise pollution while taking into account the route distance constraint. We apply our quiet routing approach to the city of Heidelberg (Germany). The application results demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms in the generation of quiet routes customized to pedestrian preferences.},

This framework however disregards the sound levels variations, and hence prevents the production of statistical or emergence indicators, and does not allow for the study of competition between typical urban sound sources that can improve the characterization of urban sound environments. A modeling framework in four steps is proposed to answer these issues: (i) a spatial distribution of the potential sound source of interest, (ii) the calculation of a sound propagation matrix, (iii) the stochastic activation of a sound sources ratio for n iterations of the sound map, and (iv) the calculation of specific sound indicators. The stochastic approach proposed in this study enables the estimation of the temporal sound distribution per sound source. It permits in particular to deduce source-oriented indicators such as the percentage of the time when a given sound source emerges from an urban sound mixture. An example of application of this framework is exposed for a district in the city of Nantes, France. It shows the interest of such approaches, in particular for soundscape and urban sound environment studies.},

Addressing this issue, the author has developed a road traffic noise prediction system that allows prediction of sound levels using a database of road network. The objective of the present study was to predict road traffic noise in the vicinity of the trunk roads using a Digital Road Map Platform (DRM-PF) database, which contains nationwide road geometries and traffic settings of trunk roads. Predicted sound levels were compared with actual measurements and noise maps were created to demonstrate the feasibility of assessing noise exposure and associated health risks in the vicinity of trunk roads in Japan. The results show a generally good agreement between predicted and measured levels, while challenges remain in accurate prediction in a number of environments, mainly due to the lack of accurate geometries. The extensive coverage of the DRM-PF database throughout Japan enables noise mapping in arbitrary regions near trunk roads, which would contribute to making noise policy.},

	abstract = {Currently, the European Union has adopted a series of measures to combat noise problems, focusing on some key indicators, such as the daily and night level of noise. Among the possible actions to manage environmental noise, there are the creation of noise maps and the adoption of action plans. Noise maps are, usually, produced by modelling and simulating data relating to traffic and various activities of an area. However, in some cases, these input data are not available or it is not possible to include all noise sources in the models used, causing difficulties in the prediction and analysis of the environmental impacts of noise. In this paper, starting from the analysis of open-source software tools for data collection, noise modelling and mapping, i.e. Openstreet Map, Noise Modelling and QGIS, based on free and public licenses, a methodology for the creation of noise maps will be presented. Finally, the outputs of the application of the methodology to the city centre of the Municipality of Nocera Inferiore, in south Italy, will be the creation of noise maps characterized by the spatial representation of the main standard noise indicators.},

The proposed approach allows to use the tools and methods proposed in the NoiseModelling software by importing MATSim outputs, therefore, taking full advantage of the development work carried out within the two communities. As such, it enables both characterizing the individual exposure to road traffic-related noise and investigating noise exposure inequality problems based on the attributes of individuals and their activities.},

So far, priority has been given to very large-scale systems connected to national energy systems, wind farms whose highly variable output power could be regulated by large power systems. Nowadays, with the development of small storage capacities, it is feasible to install small power wind turbines in cities of up to 10,000 inhabitants too. As a case study, we propose a simulation for a rural locality where individual wind units could be used. This specific case study is interesting because it provides a new perspective of the impact of noise on the quality of life when the use of this type of system is implemented on a large scale. This option, of distributed and small power wind turbine, can be implemented in the future as an alternative or an adding to the common systems.},

The computational cost makes these models unsuitable for applications such as uncertainty quantification, where thousands of simulations may be required. One solution is to replace the model with a meta-model that reproduces the expected noise levels with highly reduced computational costs. The strategy is to generate the meta-model in three steps. The first step is to generate a training sample exploring the large dimension model's inputs set. The second step is to reduce the dimension of the outputs. In the third step, statistical interpolators are defined between the projected values of the training sample over the reduced space of the outputs. Radial basis functions or kriging are used as interpolators. The meta-model was built using the open source software NoiseModelling. This study compares the proximity of the meta-model outputs to the model outputs against the reduced basis, the class of the kriging covariance function, and the training sample size. Simulations using the meta-model are more than 10 000 times faster than the model while maintaining the main behavior.},

The present contribution proposes a receiver-centric mapping approach, introducing “noise-exposure sensitivity maps”, meant to assess the potential noise exposure impact from a specific vehicle in a given network, quantifying the associated exceedance over the prevailing background noise, under varying spatiotemporal traffic conditions. The resulting maps are thus focussed on a representation of the receiver exposure as opposed to considering the noise emission and propagation alone.

The agent-specific noise exposure cost is a measure to evaluate how the noise emissions from the transport of agents relate to the noise-related impact on other agents performing stationary activities. By introducing an agent-specific level, each agent’s individual responsibility for the noise exposure may be estimated. The potential of the agent-specific noise exposure cost concept, combined with the MATSim-NoiseModelling framework, is illustrated through a case study, applying activity-based agent mobility simulations across Nantes, France. The results of the case study highlight, among other considerations, the insights that an agent-specific, activity-based noise exposure cost approach provides by visualizing the noise exposure ”footprint” resulting from an agent’s transportation activities.},

	abstract = {The relevance of noise maps for large cities following the European Directive 2002/49/EC is questionable,because of poor quality or insufficient accessibility of input data and the large number of input parameters. Inthe framework of the CENSE project, a sensitivity analysis of noise mapping models to their inputs is proposedin two parts. On one hand, the integration of different sources of data, from academic or open access databasessuch as OpenStreetMap, was analyzed. On the other hand, a global sensitivity analysis with the Morris methodwas carried out on 15 of the input parameters of the CNOSSOS-EU models (Directive UE 2015/996). Thesetwo studies help to better label and qualify the input data by prioritizing some sources of information andparameters. All these developments were integrated into the open-source tool NoiseModelling ensuring thereproducibility of the results. Acoustic predictions were also compared with available online noise maps for afew French cities.},

	abstract = {Data-driven modeling of complex physical systems is receiving a growing amount of attention in the simulation and machine learning communities. Since most physical simulations are based on compute-intensive, iterative implementations of differential equation systems, a (partial) replacement with learned, 1-step inference models has the potential for significant speedups in a wide range of application areas. In this context, we present a novel benchmark for the evaluation of 1-step generative learning models in terms of speed and physical correctness. Our Urban Sound Propagation benchmark is based on the physically complex and practically relevant, yet intuitively easy to grasp task of modeling the 2d propagation of waves from a sound source in an urban environment. We provide a dataset with 100k samples, where each sample consists of pairs of real 2d building maps drawn from OpenStreetmap, a parameterized sound source, and a simulated ground truth sound propagation for the given scene. The dataset provides four different simulation tasks with increasing complexity regarding reflection, diffraction and source variance. A first baseline evaluation of common generative U-Net, GAN and Diffusion models shows, that while these models are very well capable of modeling sound propagations in simple cases, the approximation of sub-systems represented by higher order equations systematically fails. Information about the dataset, download instructions and source codes are provided on our website: https://www.urban-sound-data.org.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to make recommendations about the convenience of using low-noise pavements to mitigate traffic noise under different traffic and population scenarios. To do so, a life cycle approach has been applied by performing a Life-cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life-cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA). To account for the noise mitigation achieved by the road surfaces, which is the main benefit compared to conventional road surfaces, the damage effect of traffic noise has been incorporated in both analyses. Thus, open source noise emission and propagation modelling and Geographical Information System (GIS) tools have been used to determine the noise level at which residents are exposed. The impact of noise emissions on human health is estimated and expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and the related external cost have been calculated by monetarizing the environmental impacts and by integrating them within the cost assessment. The methodology followed allowed the comparison of different scenarios and the results show a huge potential for reducing environmental impacts and costs when using low-noise road surfaces although accurate information about the acoustic aging of the materials is key in order to ensure that benefits are obtained.},

	abstract = {Agent-based models represent a promising approach for simulating transport systems and assessing their environmental noise impact, potentially enhancing standard noise exposure assessments. However, it is very important to understand the relevance of these assessments within the context of models initially designed for transport studies. Then, this research investigates the utilization of agent-based transport models when coupled with environmental models to assess individual exposure to transport-related noise. This is achieved by proposing a method to evaluate this approach across four dimensions: spatial, temporal, individual, and activity patterns. This evaluation is demonstrated and discussed with an exemplification model applied in the Lyon Metropolitan Area using open-source tools (MATSim, EQASim, NoiseModelling), which is a representative framework of the current literature. The findings encompass a range of issues, including the conceptualization of exposure contexts and activity spaces, the resolution of the acoustic content, the disaggregation of data at the individual level, the variability in noise reactions, and the correlation structures between social and exposure profiles. The study contributes to the advancement of exposure assessment with insights for future improvements in the field. Further, it underscores the need for more quantitative analyses and scientific research into momentary noise exposure and social epidemiology.},

Road traffic is, by far, the largest contributor to this noise pollution in urban areas. With the growing electrification of cars in developed
countries, it is commonly believed that road traffic noise pollution and the associated problems will disappear shortly in urban areas. However, at high speeds, the difference in noise emissions between internal-combustion-engine and electric vehicles is not significant, and at low speeds,
the propulsion noise of electric cars is not negligible. Few works have quantitatively estimated the actual impact of passenger cars electrification on population exposure to noise, especially considering such aspects as the gradual transition towards a fully electric fleet. The present contribution
thus aims to assess the evolution of population exposure to noise pollution, using a microscopic traffic simulation on the scale of an entire city, noise mapping, and various indicators, at multiple stages of this transition.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, research has been dedicated to refining models for assessing traffic noise levels, supporting national authorities in addressing associated problems. Progress has shifted from basic statistical models to dynamic ones, typically composed of a Noise Emission Model
(NEM) for estimating source sound power levels and a sound propagation model for assessing equivalent noise levels at specific receiver points. These models commonly integrate the average speed of traffic flow as an input variable, placing them in the macroscopic or mesoscopic realm. The CNOSSOS-EU
model (reference in Europe) exemplifies this macroscopic approach. However, due to the modular structure of road traffic noise models, a NEM can be coupled with different sound propagation models, facilitating the transition from macroscopic to microscopic assessments. This paper demonstrates
the coupling of a NEM with two distinct simplified sound propagation models: CNOSSOS-EU and the sum of Sound Exposure Levels (SEL) models. The latter approach showcases the potential of using individual on-road vehicle speeds as inputs, enabling microscopic noise assessments. Vehicle speed
data is extracted from video records, while the goodness of the proposed approaches is tested by comparing the models' estimations with ground truth values recorded on a National Road in Portugal.},
