Directivity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NoiseModelling is a tool for producing noise maps. To do so, at different stages of the process, the application needs input data, respecting a strict formalism.

Below we describe the table ``DIRECTIVITY``, containing all the directivity parameters. 

The other tables are accessible via the left menu in the ``Input tables`` section.

	If you want to see how to use this table, have a look to the tutorial ":doc:`Noise_Map_From_Point_Source`" , in the section ``Step 5 (bonus): Change the directivity``
